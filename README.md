# Welcome to my Portfolio Frontend

Heyo, glad you're reading this!


First, thats the frontend of the entire portfolio. That means you could find the backend, where i've put the other functionalities: [Jason21tod/me-and-who-iam: My profissional Portfolio](https://github.com/Jason21tod/me-and-who-iam)

So, this project was made using react ( Create react app ), css and html5, then, you can just download and run npm start to begin the execution.
Actually, the code functions and ideas are not documented, the next steps are just to make the code clear and comprehensive, but, if you want to check how this or that works, fell free to look, finally, pull requests/sugestions and any tips are apreciateds and requested. Thank you!
